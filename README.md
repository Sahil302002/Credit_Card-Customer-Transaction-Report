### **About This Project**:

This project focuses on analyzing **Credit Card Transactions** and **Customer Details** data to derive valuable insights related to customer behavior, financial transactions, and credit usage patterns. The project leverages **Power BI** and **SQL Server** to process and visualize large datasets, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions related to customer acquisition, retention, and credit management.

The dataset comprises two key tables: **Credit Card** data, which includes detailed records on credit card transactions, fees, and usage patterns, and **Customer Details**, which contains demographic, financial, and satisfaction data for each cardholder. This analysis aims to provide insights on customer segmentation, credit card usage trends, and the impact of various factors such as income, age, and card category on customer behavior and satisfaction.

By utilizing Power BIâ€™s advanced visualizations and DAX queries, the project helps in identifying actionable insights, such as the most profitable customer segments, transaction behaviors, credit utilization trends, and customer satisfaction drivers. This allows for better-targeted marketing efforts, improved customer service strategies, and optimized credit offerings.

### **Project Overview**:

In this finance-related data analysis project, the main goal was to analyze and visualize **Credit Card Transactions** and **Customer Data** to derive insights on customer behavior, card usage, and financial trends. The project utilized **Power BI** for visualization, connected to **SQL Server** to manage and process large datasets.

The project involved several important steps:

1. **Data Import and Connection**: Data was imported into **SQL Server** from CSV files containing detailed records of credit card transactions and customer information. Power BI was then connected to SQL Server to retrieve and process the data.
2. **Data Transformation and Processing**: Using **Power Query**, data was cleaned, transformed, and enhanced by adding new calculated columns. This included creating age and income groups for customer segmentation.
3. **DAX Queries**: Various DAX queries were used to analyze transaction patterns, calculate utilization ratios, and create meaningful aggregations that can provide deeper insights into customer behavior.
4. **Visualizations**: After processing the data, Power BI was used to create dynamic dashboards, presenting key metrics such as transaction volumes, total spending, customer satisfaction scores, and delinquency rates.

The final output of this project was an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to analyze various aspects of credit card usage and customer demographics.
